title: The Case For Buying Used Books
---

Books are a valuable resource, but they can also be expensive. New books can cost upwards of 1.5k birr, and that's not even counting the latest bestsellers.


If you're a voracious reader, or if you're on a budget, buying used books is a great way to save money. 
There are many reasons why you should buy used books. Here are just a few:

- **Save money.** Used books are typically much cheaper than new books. You can often find used books for half the price of a new copy. This is a great way to save money, especially if you're a voracious reader. 

- **Reduce waste.** When you buy a used book, you're not creating new demand for paper and other resources. This helps to reduce waste and protect the environment. Says my research while writing this.

- **Support local businesses.** Many used bookstores are independently owned and operated. When you buy from a used bookstore, you're supporting your local economy. Donâ€™t ask me how. 

- **Find unique books.*** Used bookstores often have a wide variety of books that you won't find in new bookstores. This is a great place to find rare and collectible books, or to find books that have been out of print for years. 

- **Add character to your bookshelf.** Used books have a certain charm that new books just don't have. The pages are often yellowed and worn, and there may be notes or markings from previous owners. This adds character to your bookshelf and makes your books feel more personal.

If you're looking for a way to save money, reduce waste, and support local businesses, then buying used books is a great option. There are many benefits to buying used books, and they're a great way to build your personal library.
