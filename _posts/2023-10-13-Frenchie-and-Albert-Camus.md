Frenchie, a character from the popular Amazon Prime Video series The Boys, which inherently i have fallen in love with, and Albert Camus i mean if you don't know who Albert Camus is **What are you doing with your life ? HUH ? Get educated !!**

Camus is French philosopher, writer, and journalist, how the fuck am i comparing a philosopher and a movie character come on its me uk me i got the philosophy in my blood just like the V.

But they share many similarities. Both Frenchie and Camus were outsiders who struggled to find their place in the world. They were both idealists who fought for what they believed in, even when it was difficult. And they both had a deep understanding of the human condition, including the darkness and the light.


And They both love dancing in algers just saying

Frenchie is a French Resistance fighter who joins the Boys, a vigilante group that fights superheroes who have become corrupt and abusive. He is a skilled mechanic and weapons expert, but he is also a kind and compassionate person. He is often the voice of reason in the group, and he always tries to see the good in people. And is high most of the time, gotta love that. 


Albert Camus was a French philosopher, writer, and journalist. He is best known for his essays on the Absurd, such as The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel. Camus believed that the universe is indifferent to human suffering, but that humans should still strive to find meaning in life. Get yourself a cup of coffee if you know what i mean. 


One of the key similarities between Frenchie and Camus is their understanding of the Absurd. The Absurd is the conflict between human beings' desire for meaning and purpose and the reality that the universe is meaningless and indifferent.

Frenchie experiences the Absurd on a daily basis. He sees the corruption and abuse of power by superheroes, and he knows that he is unlikely to ever be able to change the world. But even in the face of this absurdity, Frenchie never gives up hope. He continues to fight for what he believes in, even when it is difficult.

Camus also believed that the world is absurd. He wrote that *"the only way to deal with an absurd world is to live without appeal."* This means living without the hope of reward or meaning, but simply because it is the only way to live.


Another key similarity between Frenchie and Camus is their rebellion against the Absurd. Camus believed that humans should rebel against the Absurd by living life to the fullest and fighting for what they believe in.

Frenchie embodies this rebellion. He fights against the corrupt superheroes, even though he knows that he is unlikely to win. He also rebels against the indifference of the universe by finding meaning in his relationships with his friends and in his fight for justice.

He even fight through the discomfort faced to him by his leaders first nina then butcher going all berserk on the temp V. And his abusive Dad.

Frenchie and Camus both had a deep understanding of the human condition, including the darkness and the light. Frenchie knows that people are capable of great evil, but he also believes that they are capable of great good. Camus also believed that humans are capable of both good and evil. He wrote that *"man is the only creature that knows that he is mortal, and the only one who refuses to know it."*

Frenchie's understanding of the human condition is evident in his relationship with Kimiko. Kimiko is a former supervillain who has been traumatized by her experiences. Frenchie helps Kimiko to heal and to find her humanity. He shows her that there is still good in the world, even though she has seen the worst of it.


Frenchie and Albert Camus are two struggling heroes who share many similarities. They are both outsiders who have a deep understanding of the human condition. They are both idealists who fight for what they believe in, even when it is difficult. And they both rebel against the absurdity of the universe.

Frenchie and Camus' stories are important because they remind us that there is always hope, even in the darkest of times. They also remind us that we should never give up on our ideals, no matter how difficult things may seem.
