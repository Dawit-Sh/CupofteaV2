In the previous blog post i explained why Mugen is an ideal for masculinity, you can read it [Mugen; An Ideal For Masculinity – Cup Of Tea – Your Daily Dose Of Philosophy](https://dawit-sh.github.io/CupofteaV2/Permalink/) here. 
So now in this blog post i will try to show that Jin can also be an ideal for masculinity because he poses certain characteristics that i think every man should poses and is yin to mugens yang.

Jin is a skilled swordsman and a wandering ronin. He is also a complex and well-developed character who embodies many of the qualities that make for an ideal masculinity.

First, Jin is strong and capable. He is a skilled swordsman who can hold his own against any opponent. He is also physically fit and agile, able to move with grace and speed. This strength and capability make him a protector and provider, qualities that are traditionally associated with masculinity.

Second, Jin is independent and self-reliant. He does not need anyone to take care of him, and he is always willing to help others. This independence and self-reliance make him a man of honor and integrity, qualities that are also valued in traditional masculinity.

Third, Jin is compassionate and kind. He is always willing to help those in need, even if it means putting himself in danger. This compassion and kindness make him a caring and nurturing figure, qualities that are often overlooked in traditional masculinity. He is also well trained in the martial arts unlike mugen who freestyles the samurai technique 

Fourth, Jin is intelligent and resourceful. He is able to think quickly and solve problems creatively. This intelligence and resourcefulness make him a valuable asset to any group, and they also make him a man of wit and humor.

Fifth, Jin is humble and modest. He does not brag about his accomplishments, and he is always willing to learn from others. This humility and modesty make him a man of wisdom and understanding. Unlike mugen who dunks in your face but honestly we need a bit of mugen in us can't argue with that, some people don't get it unless you dunk on them.

In conclusion, Jin is an ideal for masculinity because he embodies many of the qualities that are traditionally valued in men. He is _strong, capable, independent, compassionate, intelligent, resourceful, humble, and modest_. These qualities make him a man of honor, integrity, caring, wit, humor, wisdom, and understanding. He is a role model for all men, and he is a reminder that masculinity can be expressed in many different ways.

Jin is an inspiration to many people, and he shows that it is possible to be a strong and capable man without being aggressive or macho. He is a reminder that masculinity can be expressed in many different ways, and that it is important to be kind, compassionate, and understanding. That is why through out the series we see Jin being the yin to Mugens yang. Balancing out the equation Le Chatelier's principle.
