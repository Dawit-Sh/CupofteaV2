title: My Note Taking System - pt 2.

*Productivity As a Linux User and Uni Student*

Well this here is a part 2 for the previous blog i wrote, you can check it out [here](https://dawit-sh.github.io/CupofteaV2/Note-taking-System/). There is no certain of appropriate way of reading this blog because it does not follow any certain path as this is not a guide.

### LogSeq
So how did i discover logseq and got it integrated into my life or workflow you can say. Well after my [google keep](https://dawit-sh.github.io/CupofteaV2/Google-keep/) post and how i use it for capturing ideas and why i chose to use it. I got a comment from one of my friends to include open source software.(*not like that mf'er uses a complete FOSS stuff, the hypocrisy ikr*)

But yeah i did not complain i thought about it, there are tons of open source software out there i could use but i wanted something simple, obsidian like if there was one and supports markdown. I opened my firefox browser and jumped right into researching stuff and the name *LogSeq* kept popping up in every post and subreddit comment. Now the name is not new to me, because one of my favorite obsidian youtuber uses LogSeq and obsidian in conjunction (great guy btw [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SantiYounger)) so i just jumped to flathub installed it and started reading and watching videos on it.


<u><i>So How Do I use it now ?</i></u>

Now LogSeq is an outliner, meaning it lets you take notes in bullet format and use indentation and blocks to differentiate, might sound like heavy words but its just a simple terminology.

i hope this graph gave you a bit of an idea and if you want to dive deep into this logseq as your second brain for PKM stuff check out the [Resources](#Resources) section.

Now my workflow in LogSeq is quite similar to that of my google keep i just have a bunch of different templates in place set to help me with quicker capture for for query. one of the best features i never knew i needed but i use often now is LogSeq query, but the downside of using logseq as capture is i don't have a sync method, i do know they have a paid plan but too broke to pay to sync. i could use syncthing but what about when i am out? Using relay servers and hosting my syncthing on linode servers does not sit well for me. So if i do find anything new i would update on the sync part.

But other than that the LogSeq journal where it opens up a new day block empty for you to just jot down ideas and clear up later is such a great thing. It give you this freedom of thought.

This is what my day to day journal would look like

and one thing that made LogSeq feel like home is the graph feature, I KNOW RIGHT 
feels like i am in the obsidian environment i grew comfort in.

and the other best part is most of the plugins available in obsidian are also here like excalidraw, omnivore, vim shortcuts and so on even the same monokai theme. 

To summarize all i capture all ideas on logseq and i tag them have different tags for everything techtips, fleeting, random ... And so on. Then after that i have logseq pages setup for each tag where luckily LogSeq queries all the places that tag was used for me, and using that i clear up the necessary stuff and move it to my Neorg note system.
