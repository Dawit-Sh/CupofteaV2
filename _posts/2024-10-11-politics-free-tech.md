title: Can We Keep Tech Politics Free?
---

*current state of politics and tech... rants*

One of the most annoying things about being in the tech industry is, whether you want it or not it is affected by politics and ideology. Whether you identify as right, left, center, top, bottom... alien, or whatever you want you cannot escape it. This leads to a lot of fluctuations in the tech industry and between the people in it.

<h2 id="WIP"> What is Politics </h2>
In order to understand what politics we need to go back to Ancient Greece, we can say because everything we now know of stems from there and what ever we think we created is just a footnote of Ancient Greece philosophy. In Ancient Greece, politics was tied to the concept of the [**polis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis) (πόλις), which is referred to the city-state a central political and social unit. The term [**politics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics) itself comes from the Greek word **politika** (πολιτικά), meaning "affairs of the cities." In the Greek tradition, politics was seen as the art of managing the state, making decisions for the common good, and engaging in discourse about justice, laws, and governance.

[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) and [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) made significant contributions to political thought. Plato’s ideal of the [philosopher-king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_king) emphasized that the most knowledgeable should rule, while Aristotle’s exploration of different political systems in works like *Politics* laid the foundation for many political theories. Aristotle believed humans are by nature "political animals" (ζῷον πολιτικόν), meaning that people inherently seek to live in a society with shared governance and laws. For Greeks, politics were not related only to power but to virtues, ethics, and civic responsibilities; therefore, the personal and political are intertwined. The bequest lies in modern political theory on governance, democracy, and citizenship.

The typical view is that politics involves activities, actions, and policies used to achieve and maintain power in government or to influence the governance of a society. It relates to the **distribution and exercise of power**, decision-making processes, and the negotiation of differences among individuals or groups. Politics operates within and across several institutions, including governments and political parties, practices such as elections and diplomacy, and ideologies ranging from democracy to socialism and authoritarianism.  
In a broader sense, **politics is how resources are allocated and how rights and responsibilities are accorded to people from competing interests.** 


<h2 id="PIT"> Politics In Tech </h2> 
While the politics in tech differs from the politics that govern countries and worlds, it refers to decision-making process, influences and power dynamics. So you might say how can this be different from the default politics? It encompasses how companies, developers, governments and stakeholders interact and make choices that shape the direction of technology, its regulation, and its social impact.  

Companies such as Google, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have left impressive marks on the development of technology and world markets. Many of their business decisions, mergers, and market strategies have huge ramifications and raise a variety of issues related to monopoly, anti-competitive activities, and putting economic power in the hands of a few. 

This can span into a range of topics including ethics, free speech, content moderation, power and what not. But the issues raised when trying to keep tech politics free are not this because this restriction may help propel tech forward or even hold it back at times, but having regulations on AI and mass data gathering is essential while forcing backdoor in new products might hold them back. But if we start diving into that territory it is going to get messy. 

<h2 id="WITPIT"> Why Is There Politics In Tech </h2>


If we are speaking the truth it is because the government is a bit nosy, as we tried to cover in the definition of politics which means distribution and exercise of power, and what does the government want… Correct **Power**. In this day and age the influence of technology is immense it penetrates nearly every aspect of our life, including communication, economy, privacy, and security. 

While it's not all gloom and doom that the government is dipping its fingers in every jar of milk out there it comes with its benefits as well. For example large tech companies hold enormous power over markets, data, and public life. The benefit of the government's intervention in these companies prevents them from building this empire where they exercise unlimited power. ([Current State of Google](<[DoJ likely to break up Google into smaller businesses; Here’s how it plans to do so – Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/doj-likely-to-break-up-google-into-smaller-businesses-heres-how-it-plans-to-do-so-13824057.html)>)). They keep them in check and make sure nothing fishy is going on, one of the most known government body dominating the tech industry is the European Union, you know how much powerful they are when they force apple into allowing side loading of apps ([More](<[iPhone users in the EU may get app sideloading in early 2024 | TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/iphones-in-the-eu-could-get-ios-app-sideloading-next-year-heres-what-that-means)>)). The EU have laws such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation), [official doc](https://gdpr-info.eu/)) which is designed to ensure that tech companies handle data responsibly and transparently. 

As we are moving towards a world that is soon to be dominated by AI or is barely dominated by AI and autonomous systems, governments wants to get a strong hold on those so they cannot be misused to overthrow them or leak classified data, Now this does not mean that the government is the night in shinning armor because in the name of ethics, fairness and equality they still get to do their mischievous actions while foreign governments stealing you nudes, or watching you laugh at a cat reel while taking a shit is considered a threat, it is within moral and ethical bounds that your government uses your data because it's your government and want nothing but the greater good for you. 

They will use that data to train their models, censor you, sell you stuff you don't need and what not. ([Facebook custom portal to censor Americans](<[EXPLOSIVE CENSORSHIP DOCUMENTS – America First Legal Releases Complete Internal Facebook Onboarding Documents Used to Train CDC Employees on How to Censor the American Public - America First Legal](https://aflegal.org/explosive-censorship-documents-america-first-legal-releases-complete-internal-facebook-onboarding-documents-used-to-train-cdc-employees-on-how-to-censor-the-american-public/)>)).  Licensing is also another politics in tech, but I will not open that can of worms. 

<h2 id="CTBFOP"> Can Tech Be Free Of Politics </h2>

The straight forward answer to this is **NO**, the world is shifting from analog to digital quickly, so every government on the planet wants to seize this opportunity to spin the tables around and turn it into a tool they can mold and use at their will, and this have been happening for a while now and will keep on happening. 

So as a programmer what can you do ? While understand the dynamics of the world currently and keeping yourself updated is essential. Because what is happening in the real world tend to take tolls on the digital on too ([.io TLD going away](https://every.to/p/the-disappearance-of-an-internet-domain)) 

Also take your time in understanding the political takes and ideologies and philosophy which the software-culture is based on. While the open source software side is labeled as a communist manifesto and while the proprietary software is the wealth of the nations which ends up splitting side and end up creating more drama than is necessary. This coupled with racism, sexism, fascism…and every *"ism"* out there, ends up making the tech world even more entangled in the political side of things, so as a programmer understanding these things and trying to keep a neutral ground where nothing but the **code** is preferred will at least help release the political and ideological tension making it a non-power dynamic space, where all you do is geek out about the code with your geek friends.

Now if all you want is to stop the government from being a peeping tom, then decentralized technologies such as blockchain & distributed networks reduce the concentration of power in one hands, making it harder for the governments to peep in all places, using more open source tools.
