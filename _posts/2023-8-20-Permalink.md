Well to anyone who knows me they know that I am a die hard fan of samurai champloo, I mean you can argue all you want but there is no other anime that compares to it in aesthetic, sound tracks … I mean Nujabes made all the sound tracks Nujabes, the nostalgic elements the underlying subtle messages, the story telling and the interlinking of ideas in the show, I mean the only show I can think of that compares to it is probably cowboy-bepop because they do have the same japanese anime director Shinichirō Watanabe other than that im free for anyone to change my mind that there is no anime better than samurai champloo out there. 

So back to the topic, let me try and convince you why mugen on of the characters of the show is an ideal for masculinity.

Mugen is a ronin, or masterless samurai, who is known for his wild and unpredictable nature. He is skilled in martial arts and is always willing to fight, even when outnumbered or outmatched. Mugen is also a skilled thief and is not afraid to bend the rules or even break the law to get what he wants.

Despite his rough exterior, Mugen is a complex and sympathetic character. He is deeply loyal to his friends and is always willing to put his life on the line for them. He is also a fiercely independent spirit (something every guy of my generations needs to learn) who refuses to be controlled by anyone. 

Mugen embodies many of the qualities that are traditionally associated with masculinity, such as strength, courage, and independence. However, he also challenges some of these traditional ideas. For example, he is not afraid to express his emotions, even if it means being vulnerable. He is also not afraid to ask for help when he needs it. Boys don’t cry but Men do isn’t that how the saying goes.

He is not afraid to be himself, even if it means breaking the mold. He is also a strong and capable individual who is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. 

For these reasons, Mugen can be seen as an ideal for masculinity. He is a complex and well-rounded character who embodies many of the positive qualities that we admire in men. He is also a reminder that there is no one right way to be a man, Why because we also have Jin another take on masculinity, I will be writing about that one sooner this week I hope.However, it is important to note that Mugen is not perfect. 

He is also capable of violence and aggression. He is also often reckless and impulsive. These are not qualities that we would necessarily want to encourage in all men. Cause some can lead to destruction but certainly if its for the greater good F*** it just do it, take the risk and do it.

Ultimately, Mugen is a good role model for masculinity. Because he is a complex and fascinating character who challenges our traditional ideas about what it means to be a man.
