Haunted Mansion is a supernatural comedy horror, interestingly enough it is a 2023 movie wich is features disney as i saw in the introduction. 

It features some big names like *Danny Devito, Tiffany Haddish, Jared leto, Owen Wilson and Lakeith stanfield* and also other actors.

So i have to warn you before i start this is going to be full of **⚠️⚠️SPOILERS⚠️⚠️**. 

Basically the movie is a sarcastic take on supernatural horror movies and honestly when i saw disney i was expecting woke stuff like lesbian ghosts or smth idk, but there was not much woke stuff even though they did not forget to mix up the race in the movie, and some subtle woke jokes poking here and there, there was nothing much about it that seemed too political to me, Just too much sarcasm on the believers and non-believers.

And i also have to mention most of the animations and the horror stuff seem like they were inspired highly by [Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King) and if you don't know who that is

**What are you doing with your life** read books more, anyhow..

this movie seems heavily inspired by two specific Stephen King novels lucky for you there are movies already, [The Shining](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/) and [Doctor Sleep](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5606664/) the collidor scenes and the astral projection real seems and some of the hinting just seems obvious that they are mentioning stephen king. 


Another thing i want to mention in movies in general is 
> What the fuck is with them and Quantum 

it's like if any movie wants to setup something complex and profound beyond the realm of human understanding they just say **Quantum** this **Quantum** that... like Nigga really created a camera that captures ghosts using Quantum Lenses which he calls ghost particle and he takes it back saying the media and news outlet said that and not him. But movies should really stop using Quantum everywhere just make up some random shit, some mathematical formula applicable only in that universe or smth just like how marvel does it.

The other funny part of this movie is that the whole premise is based on a rich kid from the 17's who was abondoned from his home for crying to much on his moms funeral because his dad thought he was a pussy and he needed to toughed up , ik ik 🤣🤣 but that is what they chose i did not know andrew tate lived in the 17's

yeah and this banished kid goes away disappears and comes back to become the richest man after his fathers death and was thought to be doing some dark magic which requires blood, i sense some great gatsby inspired story here but who am i to judge and yeah the movie deals with belivers and non-believers as i said there is science and also ghosts. 

And this hatbox ghost (yeah that is what they call the main villain for most part of the movie ) needs 1000 souls to get free and has killed 999 till now and only need 1 and still trapped 6 people in the house, i mean you could have just killed the child and set yourself free ma nigga ??? but yeah for the sake of the movie he collected all this diverse people from different professions in one house and i gotta tell you that's some sitcom level comedy in there, i just LOLED too much.. was great and for some reason this ghost wants people with grief, that being the main character the disbeliever (astrophysicist) who later on became a believer.

and the other main character or side kick which is the kid who sees ghosts and talks to his dead father and for some damn reason looks like  **a jazz nigga from the 19's**

you can see for yourself i am not joking 🤣🤣🤣. Dude looks like he taught Miles Davis how to play the sax and showed thelonius monk what the keys on the piano did, okay i will stop 🤣🤣🤣.


Anyhow the movie takes a climax when the hatbox ghost want to take the kids soul to complete his ritual and comeback and take his revenge on everyone and the psychic and the greates psychic of all time which was yoinked out of a crystal ball that the hatbox ghost trapped her in, just banish him and one of the funny parts is that my nigga ben just kicks the ghost into his grave like i thought ghosts... but nigga just yeets him into the underworld. 


*This movie packs a lot and was really entertaining to watch i highly recommend you watch if you want to have a quick laugh and just relax, i mean i was not expecting this, qudos to disney making this in 2023. i could talk tons about this movie but this is enough to give you a hint to just go ahead and watch this movie & yeah i did create a letterbox account [chill_vibez](https://letterboxd.com/chill_vibez/) movie tracking site where you can write reviews and log them dont forget to check me out there(just saying), got introduced to it by [itachi](https://besufikad17.github.io/) great dude and i think you would benefit from the site too as always hope you enjoyed this one*

*PS: there is no philosophy to this movie its just sarcasm*
